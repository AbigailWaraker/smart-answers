You’ll have to carry out a right to rent check if:

- there’s a break clause within the lease
- there’s a clause for right of re-entry for the landlord

As the property you're renting out is in England you need to check tenancies that start on or after 1 February 2016. 

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
