You don’t need to make a right to rent check if the mobile home is the person's main home.

A right to rent check will need to carried out if they lease the mobile home to another person.

As the property you're renting out is in England you need to check tenancies that start on or after 1 February 2016. 

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
