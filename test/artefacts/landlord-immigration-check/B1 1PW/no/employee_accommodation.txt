You don’t have to make a check on the person if you’re providing accommodation as a part of training or employment.

You will have to carry out a check on any adult dependents of the person if they aren’t being trained or employed.

As the property you're renting out is in Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley or Wolverhampton you need to check tenancies that started on or after 1 December 2014.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
