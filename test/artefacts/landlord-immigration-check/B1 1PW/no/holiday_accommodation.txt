You don’t need to make a check if both of the following apply:

- you're letting the property for holiday or leisure
- you're letting the property to the person for under 3 months

You’ll have to make a check if:

- you’re letting the property to the same person for longer than 3 months
- the booking for the property is open-ended
- you’ve extended the time the person has booked the property more than once

As the property you're renting out is in Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley or Wolverhampton you need to check tenancies that started on or after 1 December 2014.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
