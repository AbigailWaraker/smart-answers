You’ll have to carry out a right to rent check if:

- there’s a break clause within the lease
- there’s a clause for right of re-entry for the landlord

As the property you're renting out is in Birmingham, Walsall, Sandwell, Dudley or Wolverhampton you need to check tenancies that started on or after 1 December 2014.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
