<h2 id="fill-in-the-application-form">2. Fill in the application form</h2>

<p>Print out and fill in the <a href="/government/publications/application-to-register-an-overseas-birth">application form</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pay">3. Pay</h2>

<p>You should pay online for the registration. Email <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#098;&#105;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#114;&#101;&#103;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#110;&#113;&#117;&#105;&#114;&#105;&#101;&#115;&#064;&#102;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#117;&#107;">&#098;&#105;&#114;&#116;&#104;&#114;&#101;&#103;&#105;&#115;&#116;&#114;&#097;&#116;&#105;&#111;&#110;&#101;&#110;&#113;&#117;&#105;&#114;&#105;&#101;&#115;&#064;&#102;&#099;&#111;&#046;&#103;&#111;&#118;&#046;&#117;&#107;</a> if you’re unable to pay online.</p>

<p>The registration fee does not include any copies of the certificate, but you can order them at the same time. Cheaper copies will be available from the General Register Office or the National Records Office of Scotland, but only from September the year after you register.</p>

<p>Once you’ve paid you will be given a reference number to use on your birth registration form. You’ll also be able to scan and email your documents to check that you have the right ones.</p>

<h2 id="send-your-registration">4. Send your registration</h2>

<p>Post the registration form and documents by secure post to:</p>

<div class="address"><div class="adr org fn"><p>
  Overseas Registration Unit<br />  Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office<br />  Hanslope Park<br />  Hanslope<br />  Milton Keynes<br />  MK19 7BH<br />  United Kingdom<br />
</p></div></div>

<h2 id="return-of-your-documents">Return of your documents</h2>

<p>Once the Overseas Registration Unit gets your form and the right documents, registering the birth will usually take:</p>

<ul>
  <li>at least 12 weeks if the child doesn’t have a British passport</li>
  <li>5 working days if the child has a British passport</li>
</ul>

<p>The Overseas Registration Unit will contact you if they need more information or if they need to verify your documents. If this happens then it could take longer for the birth to be registered.</p>

<p>Your documents will be returned to you by secure courier after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them.</p>
