<p>You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of <a href="/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees">consular fees</a>.</p>

<p>You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.</p>

<p>Cheaper copies will be available from the <a rel="external" href="http://www.gro.gov.uk">General Register Office</a> in the UK, but not until September the year after you register.</p>

<h2 id="go-to-the-british-embassy">Go to the British embassy</h2>

<p>Book an appointment at the British embassy and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.</p>

<p>The mother must register the birth. If you want the father’s name on the consular birth certificate, both parents will need to swear a paternity declaration in person at the nearest consulate.</p>

<p>Paternity declarations are free. Contact the consulate for more details.</p>
