          <p>Based on your answers, the expenses you can claim and deduct are listed below. There are 2 sets of results comparing simplified expenses and calculating expenses by working out the actual costs.</p>

<h2 id="simplified-expenses">Simplified expenses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£4,500.25 to claim for cars and vans</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£216 to claim for working from home</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total to claim per year:</strong> £4,716.25</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-for-your-tax-return">What to do for your tax return</h3>

<p>Use the simplified expenses flat rates to work out your business expenses.</p>

<p>Multiply the flat rates with the <a href="/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/vehicles-">miles you drove</a>, <a href="/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/business-use-of-your-home">hours you work from home</a> or the <a href="/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses/private-use-of-business-premises">number of people who live on your business premises</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/self-assessment-tax-returns">Self Assessment tax returns</a></p>

<h2 id="calculating-expenses-by-working-out-the-actual-costs">Calculating expenses by working out the actual costs</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>£2,345 for cars and vans and motorcycles</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>£1,234 for working from home</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total to claim per year:</strong> £3,579</p>

<h3 id="what-to-do-for-your-tax-return-1">What to do for your tax return</h3>

<p>You’ll have to work out the split between private and business use for vehicles, working from home or business premises use.</p>

<p>You’ll then have to add up your expenses for your tax return and <a href="/self-employed-records">keep records</a> for every expense you want to claim, eg copies of your bills.</p>

<p>This is an estimate. You should do your own calculations for your tax return.</p>
