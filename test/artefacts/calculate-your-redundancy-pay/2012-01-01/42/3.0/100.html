<p>Pay is capped at £430 (£430 In Northern Ireland) per week. Length of service is capped at 20 years.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Information" class="application-notice info-notice">
<p>The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £12,900 (£12,900 In Northern Ireland)</p>
</div>

<p>Years of service or earnings over these amounts aren’t included in the calculation.</p>

<p>You can’t get less than the statutory amount but you may get more if your employer has a redundancy scheme. Redundancy pay up to £30,000 is tax-free.</p>

<p>Your entitlement is 3.5 weeks.</p>

<p>You get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re under 22</li>
  <li>1 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re between 22 and 41</li>
  <li>1.5 week’s pay for each full year worked when you’re 41 or older</li>
