$! You can’t currently claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) because you’re under 16.$!

If you’re still getting DLA at 16 you’ll be sent a letter inviting you to apply for PIP:

* shortly after your 16th birthday

* about 20 weeks before your [Disability Living Allowance (DLA)](/disability-living- allowance-children) award ends, if you were awarded DLA under the rules for people who are terminally ill

You must claim PIP within 28 days of the date on the letter.

You’ll continue to receive DLA until your PIP claim has been assessed.

##If your needs change

You must let Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) know if your [care or mobility needs change](/disability-living-allowance-children/eligibility). You’ll be reassessed for DLA and won’t automatically be invited to claim PIP when you turn 16.

*[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance
