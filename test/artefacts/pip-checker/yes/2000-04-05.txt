$! You can’t currently claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP) because you’re under 16.$!

If you’re still getting [Disability Living Allowance (DLA)](/disability-living-allowance-children) at 16 you’ll be sent a letter inviting you to apply for PIP:

* shortly after your 16th birthday

* when you leave hospital, if you were in hospital on your 16th birthday

* about 20 weeks before your DLA award ends, if you were awarded DLA under the rules for people who are terminally ill

You must claim PIP within 28 days of the date on the letter.

You’ll continue to receive DLA until your PIP claim has been assessed.

*[DLA]: Disability Living Allowance
*[PIP]: Personal Independence Payment
