          <p>You’re close to State Pension age. You’ll reach it on  1 February 2015.</p>

<p>Your State Pension age is 65 years.</p>

<p>You can now <a href="/state-pension/how-to-claim">claim your State Pension</a> if you haven’t already done so.</p>

<p>Once you claim your State Pension, the Pension Service will work out your full State Pension. This calculator gives you an estimate of your basic State Pension.</p>

<h2 id="your-state-pension-estimate">Your State Pension estimate</h2>

<p>You have enough qualifying years to get a full basic State Pension of £113.1 per week.</p>

<p>How much State Pension you get depends on how many years of <a href="/national-insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> you have.</p>
