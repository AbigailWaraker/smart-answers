<p>The State Pension will change on 6 April 2016. When you reach State Pension age you’ll claim the <a href="/new-state-pension">new State Pension</a>. This is an estimate of your basic State Pension under the current rules.</p>

  </tbody>

<p>This will be the least amount you will get under the new State Pension rules.</p>

<p>The State Pension age is regularly reviewed and may change in the future.</p>

<p>This estimate doesn’t include any <a href="/additional-state-pension">Additional State Pension</a> you may have before 6 April 2016. It may change if you make more <a href="/national-insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> before you reach State Pension age.</p>

<p>How much State Pension you get depends on how many years of <a href="/national-insurance">National Insurance contributions</a> you have.</p>
