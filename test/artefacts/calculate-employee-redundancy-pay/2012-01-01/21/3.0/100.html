<p>Your employee&rsquo;s entitlement is 1.5 weeks.</p>

<p>They get:</p>

<ul>
  <li>0.5 week’s pay for each full year they were under 22</li>
  <li>1 week’s pay for each full year they were 22 or older, but under 41</li>
  <li>1.5 week’s pay for each full year they were 41 or older</li>
</ul>

<p>Length of service is capped at 20 years and weekly pay at £430 (£430 In Northern Ireland). Years of service or earnings over these amounts are not included in the calculation.</p>

<p>The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is £12,900 (£12,900 In Northern Ireland).</p>
