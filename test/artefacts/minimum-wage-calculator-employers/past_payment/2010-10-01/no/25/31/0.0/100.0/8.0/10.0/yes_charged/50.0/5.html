<p>* This figure has been rounded to the nearest penny.</p>

<p>This calculation includes an additional amount the worker is entitled to by law for past payments. If the worker worked overtime or you provided <a href="/national-minimum-wage-accommodation">accommodation</a>, this has been added to the calculation.</p>

<p>This result is an estimate. If you have any questions, call the confidential helpline:</p>
