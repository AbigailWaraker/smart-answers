You canâ€™t apply for a British passport from Syria.

You can apply in a neighbouring country of your choice - pick one from the [list of countries](/overseas-passports/y) and follow the application process for that country.

If you need an emergency travel document to leave Syria, contact the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for further information.
