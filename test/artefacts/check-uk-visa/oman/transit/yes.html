          <p>You should apply for a <a href="/transit-visa">Visitor in Transit visa</a> if you arrive on a flight and will pass through immigration control before you leave the UK.</p>

<h2 id="transiting-without-a-visa">Transiting without a visa</h2>
<p>You might be eligible for ‘transit without visa’ if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you arrive and depart by air</li>
  <li>have a confirmed onward flight that leaves on the day you arrive or before midnight on the day after you arrive</li>
  <li>have the correct documents for your destination (eg a visa for that country)</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the following must also apply:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you’re travelling to (or on part of a reasonable journey to) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and have a valid visa for that country</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from (or on part of a reasonable journey from) Australia, Canada, New Zealand or the USA and it’s less than 6 months since you last entered that country with a valid entry visa</li>
  <li>you have a residence permit issued by Australia or New Zealand</li>
  <li>you have a common format residence permit issued by an European Economic Area (EEA) country or Switzerland</li>
  <li>you have a residence permit issued by Canada issued after 28 June 2002</li>
  <li>you have a uniform format category D visa for entry to a country in the <a href="/eu-eea">EEA</a> or Switzerland</li>
  <li>you have an Irish biometric visa and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland</li>
  <li>you’re travelling from the Republic of Ireland and it’s less than 3 months since you were last given permission, on the basis of holding a valid Irish biometric visa, to land or be in Ireland</li>
  <li>you have a valid USA I-551 Temporary Immigrant visa issued by the USA (a wet-ink stamp version will not be accepted)</li>
  <li>you have a valid USA permanent residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998</li>
  <li>you have an expired USA I-551 Permanent Residence card issued by the USA on or after 21 April 1998, with a valid I-797 letter authorising extension</li>
  <li>you have a valid standalone US Immigration Form 155A/155B issued by the USA (attached to a sealed brown envelope)</li>
</ul>

<p>You won’t be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force Officer decides you don’t qualify under the immigration rules. You can <a href="/transit-visa">apply for a transit visa</a> before you travel if you’re unsure whether you qualify for transiting without a visa.</p>

<div role="note" aria-label="Help" class="application-notice help-notice">
<p>E-visas or e-residence permits aren’t acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.</p>
</div>

<p>All visas and residence permits must be valid.</p>

<p>Australian paper confirmation slips are not accepted.</p>
