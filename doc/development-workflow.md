# Development workflow

## Creating a Pull Request

As the Pull Request author:

1. Open a PR with the changes you want to merge.

2. Add the "Needs factcheck" label if the changes require feedback from someone other than developers.

3. Add the "Ready for code review" label.

4. Move the associated Trello card from "In progress" to "Code review".

## Reviewing a Pull Request

As the Pull Request reviewer:

1. Assign yourself to the Pull Request.

2. Review the Pull Request.

3. Add a comment to say that the PR looks good if/when you're happy with it.

4. Add the "Passed code review" label to allow people to see at a glance that the PR has been reviewed.

## Fact-checking a Pull Request (Optional)

As the Pull Request author:

1. Replace the "Needs factcheck" label with "Waiting on factcheck".

2. Move the associated Trello card from "Code review" to "Fact check".

3. Add a comment to the associated Trello card to let the relevant people know it's ready to check.
