# Development workflow

## PR author

1. Open a PR with the changes you want to merge.

2. Add the "Waiting on factcheck" label if the changes require feedback from someone other than developers.

3. Move the associated Trello card from "In progress" to "Code review".

## PR reviewer

1. Assign yourself to the PR.

2. Review the PR.

3. If/when you're happy with the PR:
  * Add a comment to say that the PR looks good.
  * Add the "Passed code review" label to allow people to see at a glance that the PR has been reviewed.

4. Move the associated Trello card from "Code review" to "Fact check".
