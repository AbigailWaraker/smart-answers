  Based on your answers the child maintenance payment is the <%= rate_type_formatted %> rate of £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> per week.

  ^This is the total weekly amount, not the amount per child.^

  The calculator gives an estimate. The exact amount the Child Maintenance Service calculates might be different.
  <% if calculator.receiving? %>
    For example, if the paying parent also supports other children, the amount you receive may be less than this.
  <% end %>

  <% if calculator.paying? %>
    Depending on how child maintenance is arranged, fees may be added to this amount.

  [Collect and Pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> | £<%= collect_fees %> | £<%= total_fees %> | £20.00
  [Direct pay](/child-maintenance/how-to-pay) | £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> | No fees | £<%= child_maintenance_payment %> | £20.00
