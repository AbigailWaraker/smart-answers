  Your State Pension will normally be based on your own National Insurance contributions only.

  Your State Pension may be worked out in a different way if 1 of the following applied before 1977:

  - you paid National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate
  - you chose not to pay Class 2 contributions if you were self-employed

  This is also known as the [married women’s reduced rate election](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm) (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp).

  ^Your State Pension may be higher if the reduced rate election applies to you.^

  The Reduced Rate Election must have applied to you at some point within the 35 years before you reached State Pension age (not including the year you reach State Pension age). These must be tax years.

  **Example**

  You’ll reach State Pension age on 6 March 2018. This is in the tax year 6 April 2017 to 5 April 2018.

  You got married in 1975 and chose to to pay National Insurance contributions at a reduced rate.

  Your State Pension will be worked out differently if your reduced rate election still applied to you in 1982.

  ##What you may get if you have a reduced rate election

  You’ll get a State Pension of around:

  - <%= lower_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if you’re married or in a civil partnership and your partner has reached State Pension age
  - <%= higher_basic_state_pension_rate %> a week if you become widowed, divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved

  These are the maximum rates of basic State Pension a person who reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016 could get through their spouse or civil partner’s National Insurance record.

  You’ll also get any Additional State Pension that you built up before 6 April 2016 on top of this basic amount.

  This will be paid to you when:

  - you or your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age (whichever is later)
  - you reach State Pension age (if widowed or divorced)
  - you’re widowed, divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved after you reach State Pension age

  ^You won’t need to have the minimum of 10 qualifying years on your National Insurance record to get a State Pension if you’re eligible under these different rules.^

  You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

  ##If you become widowed

  You might inherit some of your spouse or civil partner’s State Pension. What you might get depends on when they reached (or would have reached) State Pension age and when your marriage or civil partnership began.

  You won’t inherit any of their State Pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before State Pension age.

  ###Your spouse or civil partner reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016

  If you were married or in a civil partnership before 6 April 2016, you may inherit:
  some of their [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension/further-information) and State Pension top up https://www.gov.uk/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions/top-up-your-state-pension.
  half their Graduated Retirement Benefit (the earnings-related State Pension people could build up between 1961 and 1975)

  You may inherit some of your spouse or civil partner’s deferral payment if they [put off claiming their State Pension](/deferring-state-pension/tax-and-inheritance) - this isn’t affected by the date of your marriage or civil partnership.

  ###Your spouse or civil partner reached or is due to reach State Pension age on or after 6 April 2016

  You may inherit some of their Protected Payment if you were married or in a civil partnership before 6 April 2016.

  ##Other help if you’re widowed

  You might be eligible for the following:

  - [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance)
  - a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment)
  - [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance)

  You should contact the [future pension centre](/future-pension-centre) if you become widowed.

  ##If you get divorced or your civil partnership is dissolved

  The courts may award you a share of your former partner’s Additional State Pension if they reached State Pension age before 6 April 2016.

  If your former partner reached State Pension age after 6 April 2016, they may award you a share of their Protected Payment.
