###Applying for a Nulla Osta

You’ll need to complete a [notice for civil partnership](/government/publications/notice-for-registration-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form and a [civil partnership declaration](/government/publications/declaration-for-formation-of-civil-partnership-under-italian-law) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English or Italian.^

If you're a woman wishing to remarry or enter a new civil partnership, you must wait 300 days after:

- divorcing or the dissolution of your civil partnership
- the death of your husband or civil partner.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (eg marriage certificate or deed poll).%

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
