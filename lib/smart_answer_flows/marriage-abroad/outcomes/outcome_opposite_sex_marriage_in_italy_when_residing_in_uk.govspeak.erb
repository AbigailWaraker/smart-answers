  ###Getting a statutory declaration
  <% if calculator.partner_british? %>


    While you’re waiting for your CNI, you and your partner will need to make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/) in the UK. The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

  ###Legalisation and translation

  You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI ’[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine) by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO).

  You’ll also need to get your CNI [translated](/government/publications/italy-list-of-translators-and-interpreters) and sworn before the Italian courts or an Italian Justice of the Peace.
