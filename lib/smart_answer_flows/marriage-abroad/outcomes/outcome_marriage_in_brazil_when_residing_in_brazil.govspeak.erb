  You’ll need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a notary public stating that you’re free to marry.

  You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

  [Download ‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2)

  [Download ‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form)
  $D


  The notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then give you your notice of marriage. You should take this notice to the local authorities where you’re getting married.
