###Translation

Check with the local authorities (standesamt) in Germany if you need to get your UK-issued CNI translated.

[Find a translator abroad](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

You should also check with the local authorities if you need to provide [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and translated copies of any other documents.
