          $!You aren’t affected by Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

          Because you were aged 65 or over on 8 April 2013 when PIP was introduced, you can continue to get [Disability Living Allowance](/dla-disability-living-allowance-benefit) for as long as you're eligible.

          $!Some people in England, Scotland and Wales have been invited to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP).$!

          If you're still getting Disability Living Allowance, when you'll be invited to claim PIP depends on:

          - when your DLA ends
          - your postcode area
          - if your care and mobility needs change

          ###Your DLA ends before September 2017

          You'll be told 20 weeks before your DLA ends and invited to claim PIP in most areas of England, Scotland and Wales.

          ^Contact the [Disability Benefits helpline](/disability-benefits-helpline) if your DLA payment is due to end in less than 28 days and you haven’t received a letter about making a new claim. Your payment may stop if you don’t.^

          You'll also be invited to claim PIP if you tell the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) that your care or mobility needs have changed.
