        description: Find out what benefits you might be able to receive while you're abroad and how to export them from the UK or claim them while abroad
      title: UK benefits if you're going or living abroad
      body: |
        Find out which UK benefits you might be able to get while you're abroad and how to claim them.

        The UK has social security agreements with some countries that:

        - allow you to claim UK contribution-based benefits while you're there
        - mean that your National Insurance contributions can count towards your eligibility for that country's benefits

        It's easier to organise benefits before you leave.

        ^You must meet the benefit's eligibility criteria to get it.^
