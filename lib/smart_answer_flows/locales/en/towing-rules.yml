          Work out if you’re old enough or have the right kind of licence to tow a trailer from different kinds of vehicle
      title: "Towing: licence and age requirements"
      body: |
        Use this tool to find out if you’re old enough or have the right kind of licence to tow a trailer from different kinds of vehicle.

        This tool assumes that you already have the minimum of a full car driving licence (category B). You need a full car licence before being able to tow with any larger vehicle.

        ^A full car licence already lets you tow trailers weighing no more than 750 kg. You can also tow heavier trailers with a car as long as the total weight of vehicle and trailer isn’t more than 3,500 kg.^

      options:
        "no": "No"
        "yes": "Yes"

          You can already tow trailers up to 750 kg with your D1 minibus licence.

          To tow heavier trailers you need to apply for the provisional D1+E towing with a minibus entitlement and then pass the D1+E test. The total weight of vehicle and trailer can’t be more than 12,000 kg and the fully loaded trailer can’t weigh more than the unladen vehicle.

          You can’t normally drive or tow with a minibus until you’re 21. You then need to first take the D1 minibus test to tow trailers up to 750 kg. To tow heavier trailers you’ll then need to take the D1+E towing test.

          ##Driving and towing with a minibus at 18

          In some cases you can drive and tow with a minibus at 18 if you’re taking or have passed a PCV test or Driver CPC. See the [guide to Driver CPC](/driver-certificate-of-professional-competence-cpc) for more information.
