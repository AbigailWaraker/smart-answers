      body: |
        $!You must register your child’s birth according to the regulations in the country where the child was born. They’ll give you a local birth certificate.$!

        This local birth certificate should be accepted in the UK, eg when you apply for a passport or register with a school or doctor. You might need to have it [translated and certified](https://www.gov.uk/certifying-a-document) if it isn’t in English.

        Once you’ve registered locally you may also be able to register the birth with the UK authorities. You can only do this if the child was born on or after 1 January 1983.

        You don’t need to register with the UK authorities but it means:

        - the birth will be recorded with the General Register Offices or at the National Records Office of Scotland
        - you can order a consular birth registration certificate

        ^You can still [apply for a UK passport for your child](/apply-renew-passport) even if you don’t register the birth in the UK.^

          ^You must register the birth according to the regulations in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix}.^

          You can’t register the birth with the UK authorities. However, the birth certificate you are given in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix} will be recognised and accepted in the UK, so this isn’t necessary.

          $!You must register the birth according to the regulations in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix}.$!

          You can’t register your child’s birth with the UK authorities abroad. This is because unmarried fathers can’t pass on British nationality to a child born before 1 July 2006.

          You may still be able to apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/browse/citizenship/citizenship) for the child.

          You may also be able to register the birth if you’ve married the other parent since the child was born. [Contact your local British embassy](/government/world) to find out.

          You can’t currently register the birth with the UK authorities.

          The local birth certificate, with a [certified translation](/certifying-a-document), should be acceptable for all purposes in the UK. You can apply for registration at any time in the future - check [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice) to find out if consular services have reopened in %{registration_country_name_lowercase_prefix}.
