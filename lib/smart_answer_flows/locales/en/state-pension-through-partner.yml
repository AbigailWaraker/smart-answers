        description: You may be able to increase your State Pension based on the National Insurance record

      body: |
        The new State Pension will replace the current State Pension system (which includes [basic State Pension](/state-pension) and [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension)).

        The rules for how you can increase your State Pension and what you can inherit will be different depending on when you and your spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension).


        You’ll need to know when both you and your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age to use this tool.

          You might be able to increase the amount of basic [State Pension](/state-pension) you can get up to %{higher_basic_state_pension_rate} a week if both the following apply:

          - your basic State Pension is less than %{higher_basic_state_pension_rate} a week
          - your late spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions before 6 April 2016.

          You’ll get the increase when you [claim your State Pension.](/state-pension/how-to-claim).

          ^You won’t get this increase if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.^

          You may be able to inherit a portion of your late spouse or civil partner’s [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension).

          You’ll inherit this when you [claim your State Pension](/state-pension/how-to-claim). It can also be paid as part of [Widowed Parent’s Allowance.](/widowed-parents-allowance).

          ###When you can’t inherit Additional State Pension

          ^You won’t inherit their Additional State Pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.^

          You may not be able to inherit your spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension if all of the following apply:

          - you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2010
          - your spouse or civil partner died before State Pension age
          - you’re a man who was married or in a civil partnership or a woman who was married to another woman or in a civil partnership

          ##Other help if you’re widowed

          You might be eligible for the following if you haven’t yet reached State Pension age:

          - [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance)
          - a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment)
