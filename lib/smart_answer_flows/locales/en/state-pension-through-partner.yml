        description: You may be able to increase your State Pension based on the National Insurance record

      body: |
        The new State Pension will replace the current State Pension system (which includes [basic State Pension](/state-pension) and [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension)).

        The rules for how you can increase your State Pension and what you can inherit will be different depending on when you and your spouse or civil partner reach [State Pension age](/calculate-state-pension).


        You’ll need to know when both you and your spouse or civil partner reach State Pension age to use this tool.

# Outcome 4
        current_rules_national_insurance_and_state_pension: |
          You might be able to increase the amount of basic [State Pension](/state-pension) you can get up to %{higher_basic_state_pension_rate} a week if both the following apply:

          - your basic State Pension is less than %{higher_basic_state_pension_rate} a week
          - your late spouse or civil partner had enough National Insurance contributions before 6 April 2016.

          You’ll get the increase when you [claim your State Pension.](/state-pension/how-to-claim).

          ^You won’t get this increase if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.^

          You may be able to inherit a portion of your late spouse or civil partner’s [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension).

          You’ll inherit this when you [claim your State Pension](/state-pension/how-to-claim). It can also be paid as part of [Widowed Parent’s Allowance.](/widowed-parents-allowance).

          ###When you can’t inherit Additional State Pension

          ^You won’t inherit their Additional State Pension if you remarry or form a new civil partnership before you reach State Pension age.^

          You may not be able to inherit your spouse or civil partner’s Additional State Pension if all of the following apply:

          - you reached State Pension age before 6 April 2010
          - your spouse or civil partner died before State Pension age
          - you’re a man who was married or in a civil partnership or a woman who was married to another woman or in a civil partnership

          ##Other help if you’re widowed

          You might be eligible for the following if you haven’t yet reached State Pension age:

          - [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance)
          - a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment)
          - [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance)

# Outcome 7 for after April 2017
        new_pension_and_protected_payment: |
          You might be able to increase your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) if you’re a woman and have ever paid the ‘Reduced Rate Election’ (also known as the Married Woman’s Stamp) before 1977.

          This meant that you:

          - paid National Insurance contributions [at a reduced rate](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ni/reducedrate/marriedwomen.htm)
          - were an employed or self-employed woman between 1948 to 1977
          - were married before May 1977

          You must have paid the Reduced Rate Election within the last 35 years. This includes the entire tax year in the 35th year but not the year you reach State Pension age.

          $E

          EXAMPLE

          $E

          ##Claiming your pension

          You’ll get a pension based on the full rate of the basic State Pension.

          You’ll get the increase when you reach State Pension age.

          You’ll get more if your [State Pension](/new-state-pension) is higher under your own National Insurance contributions.

          ##Inheriting an Additional State Pension or a Protected Payment

          What you might be able to inherit depends on when you’re widowed.

          If you’re widowed before 6 April 2016 you may be able to inherit a portion of your partner’s [Additional State Pension](/additional-state-pension/further-information).

          This will also be based on the contributions to the Additional State Pension up to 6 April 2016.

          If you’re widowed on or after 6 April 2016 you may be able to inherit a portion of your partner’s [Protected Payment](/new-state-pension/inheriting-or-increasing-state-pension-from-a-spouse-or-civil-partner).

          ^You won’t be able to inherit either your late partner’s Additional State Pension or Protected Payment if you remarry before State Pension age.^

          You might be eligible for [Widowed Parent’s Allowance](/widowed-parents-allowance), a [Bereavement payment](/bereavement-payment) or [Bereavement Allowance](/bereavement-allowance) if you hadn’t reached State Pension age.


          You should contact the [future pension centre](/future-pension-centre) if you become widowed.
