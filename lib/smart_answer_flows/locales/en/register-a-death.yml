        Find out how to register a death in the UK or abroad.

        You need to read different information if:

        - the person [died in Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/registering-a-death)
        - the person [died in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/death-and-bereavement/death-and-bereavement-what-to-do-when-someone-dies/registering-a-death.htm)

        If the person died on a foreign ship or aircraft, you must register the death in the country the ship or aircraft is registered in.

        You can only register a death abroad if it happened on or after 1 January 1983.
