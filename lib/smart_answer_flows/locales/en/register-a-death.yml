        Find out how to register a death in the UK or abroad.

        You need to read different information if:

        - the person [died in Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/registering-a-death)
        - the person [died in Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/death-and-bereavement/death-and-bereavement-what-to-do-when-someone-dies/registering-a-death.htm)

        If the person died on a foreign ship or aircraft, you must register the death in the country the ship or aircraft is registered in.

        You can only register a death abroad if it happened on or after 1 January 1983.

          When registering a death abroad, you need to take the following information about the person who has died:

          - their full name
          - their date of birth
          - their passport number
          - where and when the passport was issued
          - details of their next of kin, if you’re not their closest relative

          You’ll get a death certificate issued by the relevant country.

          If you want a UK death certificate as well, you can also register the death at the [nearest British embassy or consulate.](/government/world) You don’t have to do this but if you do it means the death gets registered at the General Register Office in the UK.

          You can’t register a death with the British authorities in the following countries:

          - Australia
          - Canada
          - New Zealand
          - Ireland
          - South Africa

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales (but not from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man) to be cremated, this must be reported to the English or Welsh coroner, who needs to issue a Certificate for Cremation (form 6).

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales to be buried or cremated from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, this must be reported to the local registrar so that a ‘Certificate of No Liability to Register’ can be issued.

          ^It’s down to the person who brings the body home to contact the coroner or registrar.^
