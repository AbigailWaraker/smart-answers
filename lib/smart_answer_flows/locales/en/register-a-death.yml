        Find out how to register a death in the UK or abroad.

          You should register the death within 5 days.

          You can go to any [register office](/register-offices) but if you use the one in the area where the person died you’ll be given the documents you’ll need on the day.

          If you use a different register office the documents will be sent to the office in the area where the person died before they’re issued to you. This means you’ll usually wait a few days.

          ^Registering the death will take about 30 minutes - you might need to make an appointment.^
