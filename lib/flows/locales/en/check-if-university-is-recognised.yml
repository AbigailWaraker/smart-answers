          There are organisations which offer bogus degrees or degree courses. Often publicising themselves through the internet, these:
          offer qualifications that are not recognised by the authorities in any country
          use English-sounding names and addresses without actually being located in the UK
          take your money but give nothing in return, and do not give a refund

          If you suspect that an organisation which appears to be in the UK is awarding bogus degrees, contact the local Trading Standards office. The Trading Standards website allows you to locate the nearest office by entering the organisation's postcode.
