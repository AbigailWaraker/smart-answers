          ###Getting a statutory declaration

          While you’re waiting for your CNI, you should make a statutory declaration before a [solicitor or public notary](http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/find-a-solicitor/ "Law Society - find a solicitor"){:rel="external"}. The Italian authorities will need this in addition to your CNI. There’s a standard template in English and Italian that you can download and use.

          ###Legalisation and translation

          You’ll need to get your statutory declaration and CNI ‘[legalised]’ (certified as genuine) by the FCO.

          You’ll also need to get your CNI translated. The FCO has produced a list of approved translators of wedding documents - they’re all based in Italy and recognised by the Italian courts.

          s4. Make sure you’ve got all of the supporting documents you need - there’s a checklist on the form.

          ###Applying for a CNI from the high commission

          You’ll need to place a public announcement of your marriage in a local newspaper where you live for 1 week. If possible (and appropriate), this should be in English and the local language. It’s easier to do this in a weekly newspaper, as otherwise the announcement needs to appear for 7 consecutive days. 

          You can use the example below as a template.


          $E
          I,………………………………...………………………(full name) single/widow(er)/divorcee,

          of ……………………………………………………………………………….…..(full address),

          at …………….………(name and address of place where marriage has to be solemnised)

          on…………….….…..(date of proposed marriage).

          Any person knowing of any lawful impediment to the marriage should without delay notify:

          (High Commission address)
          $E

          You need to wait 21 days after placing the announcement to allow for any objections to be registered. You’ll then need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a local [solicitor or public notary] stating that you’re free to marry.

          ^You’ll both need to place separate announcements and swear separate oaths if you’re both British nationals.^
