      body: |
        Check if an employee qualifies for statutory sick pay (SSP) and how much to pay them.

        ## What you’ll need to know

        You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

        - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for them
        - you don’t provide your own occupational sick pay scheme
        - your employee has told you they’re sick within 7 days of first missing work

        You’ll also need this figure if you want to [recover the SSP](http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/employees/statutory-pay/ssp-calc.htm#5 “Calculating SSP recovery manually”){:rel=”external”} you pay from HM Revenue & Customs.
