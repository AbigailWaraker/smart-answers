      title: Find the right probate and Inheritance Tax forms
      body: |
        Probate is the legal right to deal with someone’s money, property and possessions (their ‘estate’) after they die. This is usually carried out by the person named as the ‘executor’ in the will.

        If there’s no will, you can apply for the right to do this if you’re the deceased’s next of kin (eg husband, wife or child).

        Find out how to apply for probate and what forms you need.
