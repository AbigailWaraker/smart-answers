          The DSA will tell you where your assessment will be carried out.

          The emergency control certificate
          --------

          If the assessment is satisfactory, you’ll get an emergency control certificate (ECC). It will state what extra controls on the front passenger side (if any) you need.

          You’ll need to send a copy of the ECC with your application for the ADI part 1 test.

          You can be given an ECC which is time limited. The ADI registrar may need you to complete another ECC assessment in the future if this happens.

          The qualifying tests if you have a disability
          --------

          You’ll take the same tests as everyone applying to be an ADI, but you’ll be able to take the practical tests in an automatic car.

          Vehicles you'll be able to give instruction in
          --------

          Your ADI certificate or trainee licence will restrict you to giving driving instruction in automatics only, subject to the fitting of extra controls as set out in the ECC.

          If you have a licence to drive cars with manual transmission you can still accompany a learner driver. However, any extra controls you need to take control of the vehicle in an emergency must be fitted on the passenger side of the vehicle.
