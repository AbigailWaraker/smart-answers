          What you need to do
          --------

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you. If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          Take the medical certificate showing the cause of death (signed by a doctor) with you.

          If the cause of death is unknown, sudden or unexplained it may be reported to the coroner.

          You won’t have the medical certificate, but the coroner will give you the documents you need or send them direct to the registrar. The table below shows the documents needed.

          Cause of death | Documents issued by coroner
          - | -
          Natural causes | Pink Form B - form 100B so the death can be registered - this is sent direct to the registrar, but sometimes given to you
          Unnatural causes/not enough evidence of natural causes | Order for Burial (form 101) or Certificate for Cremation (form 6) so the funeral can take place - given to you; Certificate After Inquest (form 99 (rev)) - this states the cause of death and is sent to the registrar (the death is registered by the registrar with no-one present)

          ###If form 100B is issued (ie there is no inquest)

          If available (but don't worry if not), also take the person’s:

          - birth certificate
          - marriage or civil partnership certificate

          If the body’s being brought back to England or Wales to be buried or cremated from Scotland, Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, this must be reported to the local registrar so that a ‘Certificate of No Liability to Register’ can be issued.
