        ##Topping up your State Pension
        You can choose to top up your State Pension by £1 a week to £25 a week. You’ll be able to make a ‘Class 3A voluntary contribution’ between 12 October 2015 and April 2017.

        The cost of the top up depends on how much extra pension you want to get every week, and your age when you buy the top up.

        **Example**
        You are 68 years old in October 2015. You decide that you want to get an extra £20 per week (£1,040 a year) on top of your pension.

        The cost of an extra £1 per week for a 68 year old is £827, so you multiply £827 by 20.

        You’ll make a lump sum payment of £16,540.
