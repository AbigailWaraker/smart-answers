        From 12 October 2015 to 1 April 2017 you’ll be able to make a one-off ‘Class 3A voluntary contribution’ to top up your State Pension by up to £25 per week.
        
        Calculate how much you’ll need to to contribute. You must be:

        - a man born before 6 April 1951
        - a woman born before 6 April 1953

        ###What you need to know
        
        You can choose to top up your State Pension by between £1 and £25 per week. How much you’ll need to contribute depends on:

        - how much extra pension you want to get each week
        - how old you are when you make the one-off contribution

        $E
        **Example**
        You are 68 years old in October 2015. You decide that you want to get an extra £20 per week (£1,040 a year) on top of your pension.

        The cost of an extra £1 per week for a 68 year old is £827, so you multiply £827 by 20.

        You’ll make a lump sum payment of £16,540.
