      ## A1
      you_may_already_be_entitled:
        title: You may already be able to drive a car.
        body: |
          If you’ve already passed a car driving test then your driving licence should show category B on it. This means you can drive cars and light vehicles with:

        - a 'maximum authorised mass' (MAM) of up to 3,500kg
        - no more than 8 passenger seats

        MAM is the total weight of the vehicle plus the maximum load it can carry safely.

        ^If you took your driving test in an automatic car you can only drive automatic cars and light vehicles. This will show on your licence as 'B auto'.^

        *[MAM]: Maximum Authorised Mass

        Next steps:
        Adding higher categories to your driving licence_issued_before_2001

          Otherwise you’ll have to wait until you’re 17.
