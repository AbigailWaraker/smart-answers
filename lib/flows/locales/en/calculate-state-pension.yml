          Your State Pension age was %{state_pension_age}.

          If you want to keep working you can [defer your State Pension](/deferring-state-pension/what-you-may-get). 

          If you don’t get the full State Pension you might still be able to [pay voluntary National Insurance contributions](/voluntary-national-insurance-contributions).

          How much State Pension you get depends on how many years of National Insurance contributions you have.

          You’re at the beginning of your working life and still need to make National Insurance contributions over the coming years. You’ll need 30 years to get a full State Pension.

          Your State Pension age is %{state_pension_age}.

          You’ll reach State Pension age on %{state_pension_date}.

          Your State Pension now would be £%{pension_amount} per week.

          This is £%{pension_loss} per week below the full State Pension.

          How much State Pension you get depends on how many years of National Insurance contributions you have.
