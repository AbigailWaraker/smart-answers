        This calculator gives an estimate for your basic State Pension. 

        It doesn’t estimate any [Additional State Pension.](/additional-state-pension "Additional State Pension")

        You’ll be asked for the number of years you worked and paid tax or got certain benefits. These are the years of your [National Insurance contributions](/national-insurance "National Insurance") that count towards your State Pension.

        Only count tax years from 6 April to 5 April and don’t count any years twice (eg when you were working and getting benefits). Don’t count the current tax year.
        
        Your circumstances might be different from what’s covered in this calculator. Don’t make future financial decisions based on its results.
