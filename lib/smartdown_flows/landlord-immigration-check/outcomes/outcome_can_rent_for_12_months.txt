The tenant may be able to rent your property.

You must get a positive verification from the [Landlord’s Checking Service](/link-to-service) that the tenant can rent the property.

The tenant will be able to stay in the property for 12 months. You’ll then have to make another check.

You may get a [civil penalty](/penalties-illegal-renting) if you get a Negative Verification notice and the tenant isn’t allowed to rent property in the UK.
