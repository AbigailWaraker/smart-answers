You don’t need to make a right to rent check if the mobile home is the tenant’s main home. 

A right to rent check will need to carried out if the tenant leases the mobile home to another person.

You can read the landlord’s [code of practice](/government/publications/right-to-rent-landlords-code-of-practice) on making checks for more information.
