You don’t need to make right to rent check if you’re hostel or refuge:

- that is managed by a social landlord, voluntary organisation or charity
- that isn’t operated as a commercial basis
- that is partly or wholly funded by a government department, agency or local authority

You’ll have to carry out a check in all other cases.
