You don’t need to make a check if both of the following apply:

- your letting the property for holiday or leisure
- your letting the property to the person for under 3 months

You’ll have to make a check if:

- you’re letting the property to the same person for longer than 3 months
- the booking for the property is open-ended
- you’ve extended the time the person has booked the property more than once
