# Check if someone can rent your residential property

Find out if a tenant can rent private residential property in the UK and what documents you need to check as a landlord. 

This includes private residential properties that tenants will use as their main home (including house guests and sub-tenants).

If you’ve bought a property that has tenants you should see if a check has been carried out. You’ll be responsible for carrying out further checks on your tenants.
