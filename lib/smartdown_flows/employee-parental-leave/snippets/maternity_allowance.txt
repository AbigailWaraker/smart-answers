The mother won’t have to pay tax on her Maternity Allowance. She can claim Maternity Allowance as soon as she’s been pregnant for 26 weeks.

Usually, payments start 11 weeks before the baby is due.

###Extra help

The mother could also get:

- a £500 Sure Start Maternity Grant (usually if it’s her first child)
- benefits while she’s not working
- Child Tax Credits - after the baby is born
- Child Benefit - after the baby is born
