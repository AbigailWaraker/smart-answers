##Shared Parental Leave

The primary adopter’s partner can take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL) if the primary adopter has:

- ended their adoption leave by returning to work
- given ‘binding notice’ (a decision that can’t normally be changed) to her employer of the date when they plan to end their adoption leave

SPL lasts for up to 52 weeks, minus any weeks of adoption leave taken by the primary adopter. 

The partner can take SPL in up to three blocks, going back to work between the blocks. Each block can be split up further if their employer agrees. 

The primary adopter and their partner can share SPL if they both qualify for it.
