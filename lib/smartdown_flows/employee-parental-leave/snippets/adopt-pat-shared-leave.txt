##Shared Parental Leave

The primary adopter’s partner can take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL) if the primary adopter:

- ends their adoption leave by returning to work
- gives their employer ‘binding notice’ (a decision that can’t normally be changed) of the date when they plan to end their adoption leave

SPL lasts for up to 52 weeks, minus any weeks of adoption leave taken by the primary adopter. 

The partner can take SPL in up to three blocks. Each of these blocks can be split up further if their employer agrees. 

The primary adopter and their partner can share SPL if they both qualify for it.
