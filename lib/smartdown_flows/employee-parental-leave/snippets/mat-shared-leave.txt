##Shared Parental Leave

The mother can take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL) if she has:

- ended maternity leave by returning to work
- given ‘binding notice’ (a decision that can’t normally be changed) to her employer of the date when she plans to end maternity leave
- ended maternity pay or Maternity Allowance

SPL lasts for up to 52 weeks, minus any weeks of maternity leave taken by the mother. 

She can take SPL in up to three blocks. Each of these blocks can be split up further if her employer agrees. 

The mother and her partner can share SPL if they both qualify for it.
