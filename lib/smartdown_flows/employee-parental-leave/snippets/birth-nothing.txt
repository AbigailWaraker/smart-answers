The parents can’t get maternity leave or pay, paternity leave or pay, or shared parental leave or pay. They could get:

- a £500 [Sure Start Maternity Grant](/sure-start-maternity-grant) (usually if it’s the first child)
- benefits while they’re not working
- Child Tax Credits - after the baby is born
- Child Benefit - after the baby is born
Use the [benefits calculators](/benefits-calculators) to check what benefits or tax credits they can get.
