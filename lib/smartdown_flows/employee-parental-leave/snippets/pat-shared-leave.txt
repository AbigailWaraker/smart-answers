##Shared parental leave (partner)

The mother’s partner can take [shared parental leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL) if the mother has:

- ended any maternity leave by returning to work
- given ‘binding notice’ (a decision that can’t normally be changed) to her employer of the date when she plans to end any maternity leave
- ended maternity pay or maternity allowance

SPL lasts for up to 52 weeks, minus any weeks of maternity leave taken by the mother. 

The partner can take SPL in up to three blocks, going back to work between the blocks. Each block can be split up further if their employer agrees. 

The mother and her partner can share SPL if they both qualify for it.
