##Shared Parental Leave

The mother’s partner or the secondary adopter can take [Shared Parental Leave](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay) (SPL) if the mother or primary adopter has:

- ended any maternity or adoption leave by returning to work
- given ‘binding notice’ (a decision that can’t normally be changed) to their employer of the date when they plan to end any maternity or adoption leave
- ended maternity pay or Maternity Allowance

SPL lasts for up to 52 weeks, minus any weeks of maternity or adoption leave they’ve taken.

They can take SPL in up to three blocks instead of a single stretch. Each of these blocks can be split up further if their employer agrees, for example so that they can work on a pattern of one week on and one week off.

They must tell their employer at least 8 weeks before you want to start your first block of shared leave.
