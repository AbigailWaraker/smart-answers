# Calculate your leave and pay when you have a child or adopt

Find out:

* if you can get maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave
* how much pay you can get if you take leave

Shared parental leave and pay are only available in England, Scotland and Wales.

## Before you start

You’ll need information about you and your partner (if you’ll share the care of the child with them). You’ll need to know:

* their employment statuses (eg employed or worker)
* the dates they started their current jobs
* the dates they finished work (if they’ve finished)
* how much they earn
* when they want their leave to start
* how much leave they want to take
