# Calculate your leave and pay when you have a child or adopt

Use this tool to find out: 

* if you can get maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave
* how much pay you can get if you take leave

Shared parental leave and pay are only available in England, Scotland and Wales. 

## Before you start

You’ll need information about your partner if you’ll share the care of the child with them. You’ll need to know:

* their employment status (eg employed)
* the date they started work
* the date they finished work (if they’ve finished)
* how much they earn
* when they want to go on leave
* how much leave they want to take
